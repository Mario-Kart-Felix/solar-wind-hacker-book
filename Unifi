Macros for uniffi.

Currently this is just for easily generating integration tests, but maybe we’ll put some other code-annotation helper macros in here at some point.

Macros
build_foreign_language_testcases	A macro to build testcases for a component’s generated bindings.
include_scaffolding	A helper macro to include generated component scaffolding.
